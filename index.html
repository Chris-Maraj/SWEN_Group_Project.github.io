        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        At Team Restore, we believe that everyone should have access to the top scientific research available.
        The solution that we have come up with is called Project Exlir. The main goal of this project is to save the 
        lives of diagnosed cancer patients with the intent and purpose of limiting the detriment of cancer before it
        takes its damaging toll on human life.
